# Transfer Learning for Image Classification: Exploring effective strategies

Convolutional neural networks: low-level filters convolutional layers extract are consistent across models for different image recognition tasks, making weights at these levels ideal for transfer learning. 

We explore transferring weights for different layers. Then, we examine how the complexity of the task the initial classifier was trained to solve affects performance on a task of differing complexity.
